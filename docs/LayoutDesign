Week 1 Rough Draft

1.) Login/Signup Screen
* Title: "Fantasy Loot Generator" in the top middle
* Form (centered on screen):
  * Input field: Username
  * Input field: Password
  * Login Button below the inputs
  * Signup Button with: "Sign Up"

Layout: Have everything vertically stacked and centered. (Feel free to change anything that might make it look better)

2.) Main Dashboard
Top Bar:
  * Left: "Welcome, [username]"
  * Right: Logout

Main:
  * Generate Loot Buttom
  * Loot Card Preview:
    * Item Name
    * Picture for the item
    * Type (Weapon/Armor/Potion)
    * Rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Mythic)
    * Short Description and stats
    * Optional: Add a small token on the bottom corner to represent the rarity

Inventory:
  
  * Grid of small recatangles representing items that the user generated
  * Empty slots for items that the user has not gotten yet

  * Layout: Button on top -> item card in the middle -> inventory grid at bottom
  * We can either have the invetory on a seprate page or keep it on the same as the item generator

Notes:
  * I feel like we keep the layout as simple as possible for now and polish the artistic aspects as we go
